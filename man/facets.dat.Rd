\arguments{
\item{seg}{a segmentation file containing the segmentation information of multiple patients}

\item{filenames}{the names of the segment files to be loaded and processed (Note must end in ".Rdata").}

\item{path}{the relative path to the files folder from your current directory}

\item{patients}{the names of the patients of the respective filenames. Default simply 1 to number of files.}

\item{min.purity}{the minimum purity of the sample required to be kept in the final dataset. Default is 0.3.}

\item{epsilon}{level of unions when aggregating segments between}
}
\value{
out.cn : a matrix of the union of all segment files with patients as rows and segments as columns

ploidy : a vector of the ploidy values for the patients in out.cn

purity : a vector of the purity values for the patients in out.cn

FGAs : a vector of the fragment of genome altered values for the patients in out.cn
