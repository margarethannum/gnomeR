\title{gen.tab}
\usage{
gen.tab(gen.dat, outcome, filter = 0, paired = F, cont = F,
  rank = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{gen.dat}{A matrix or dataframe, with patients as rows and features as columns.}

\item{outcome}{A leveled vector of length equal to the number of rows in gen.dat.}

\item{filter}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 (1 not included) that is the lower bound for the proportion of patients
having a genetic event (only for binary features). All features with an event rate lower than that value will be removed.
Default is 0 (all features included).}

\item{paired}{Boolean if the data are paired. Default is FALSE.}

\item{cont}{Should the outcome be treated as a continuous value. Default is FALSE treated as categorical.}

\item{rank}{Should the table returned be oredered by Pvalue. Boolean, default is T}
}
\value{
fits : a table of odds ratio and pvalues.

forest.plot : A forest plot of the top 10 hits.
}
\description{
Creates a summary table of the distribution of the genetic features by a specific outcome/covariate of interest. The difference
is tested using Fisher's exact test and further adjusted for multiple comparisons. Note that continuous genetic factors
are dichotomized at their median.

\examples{
library(gnomeR)
patients <- unique(clin$DMPID)[1:500]
mut.only <- create.bin.matrix(patients = patients,maf = mut)
gen.dat <- mut.only$mut
outcome = as.factor(as.character(clin$Sex[match(patients,clin$DMPID)]))
test <- gen.tab(gen.dat,outcome)
head(test$fits)
test$forest.plot
