facets.heatmap(seg = NULL, filenames = NULL, path = NULL,
  patients = NULL, min.purity = 0.3, epsilon = 0.005,
  ordered = NULL, outcome = NULL, adaptive = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{seg}{a segmentation file containing the segmentation information of multiple patients}

\item{filenames}{the names of the segment files to be loaded and processed (Note must end in ".Rdata").}

\item{path}{the relative path to the files folder from your current directory}

\item{patients}{the names of the patients of the respective filenames. Default simply 1 to number of files.}

\item{min.purity}{the minimum purity of the sample required to be kept in the final dataset. Default is 0.3.}

\item{epsilon}{level of unions when aggregating segments between}

\item{ordered}{order in which patients should be printed. Default NUll leads to hierarchical clustering.}

\item{outcome}{for seg file only, if outcome associated with study it will be printed along the x axis for each patient}
